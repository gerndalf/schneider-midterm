In the beginning, my primary difficulty came from trying to adapt thinking about pushing HTTP requests
to an index.php rather than using separate URLs. Proper checks and includes make this easier than initially
expected but is an overall much easier and more streamlined way of performing operations.

It took some decent time fully understanding the required API responses to certain operations (i.e. returning
feedback rather than just data). There was definitely some back and forth deciding where and how I wanted
these responses to be given.
